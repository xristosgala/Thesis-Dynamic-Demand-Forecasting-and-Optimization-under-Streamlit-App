# Dynamic Demand Forecasting and Optimization: Improving the Management of Crisis-Driven Food Supply Chains

This repository contains the materials for my Master’s thesis, completed as part of the MSc in Data Science at the International Hellenic University (Thessaloniki, Greece).

The research focuses on forecasting food demand under crisis conditions and optimizing supply decisions by combining machine learning and operations research techniques.

## Repository Contents

- **Christos Galanis Thesis.pdf**  
  The final version of the thesis, providing a complete and detailed explanation of the methodology, experiments, and results.

- Food Demand Forecasting.ipynb  
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and three alternative demand forecasting approaches using XGBoost for food order prediction.

- Linear Programming  
 Optimization results based on the best-performing XGBoost model. Forecasted demand is used as input to a Linear Programming (LP) model to determine optimal food order quantities under multiple constraints.

- Streamlit App  
  An interactive application that integrates the forecasting and optimization pipelines, adapted for deployment using Streamlit.
